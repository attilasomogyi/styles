# Support

First of all, The project members are happy that your are by using **Vale custom styles**.
This project hopes that there are no questions related to its use.
If you have any questions.

## Please questions post it on Stack Overflow

Avoid open issues for general support questions because this project want to keep GitHub
issues for bug reports and feature requests. Instead, project recommends by using [Stack
Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/vale) to ask
support-related questions. When creating a new question on Stack Overflow, make
sure to add the `vale` tag.

Stack Overflow is a much better place to ask questions since:

- there are thousands of people willing to help on Stack Overflow
- questions and answers stay available for public viewing so your
  question or answer might help someone else
- Stack Overflow's voting system assures that the best answers are prominently
  visible.

To save your and this project time, The project is going to systematically close all issues that are
requests for general support and redirect people to Stack Overflow.

_Thank you for your cooperation._
